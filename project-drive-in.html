		<h2>Project: Drive-In</h2>
		<p>By taking a look at how most modern drive-in and fast food stores operate, how might we improve the dining experiences in these places and excite our customer base? 

		We re-imagined this environment and provided a space that customers would visit, return to and enjoy.</p>

		<h2>Audience</h2>
		<p>Who are the target customers for this project? I interviewed several peers to jump-start the research portion of our case study. Working on-site at two Sonic Drive-In locations we found that the age range for most customers varied, but predominantly we observed 18 - 29 as the biggest age group at the drive-in. At that point, I focused most of our attention on a younger crowd. The majority of our customers are busy and on-the-go (students/full-time workers) looking for a quick bite, some younger customers are out with friends looking for a cheap meal, others had their hands full with a young family in tow. The late-night crowed take advantage of the open hours for a meal.

		<h2>Constraints</h2>
		<p>This project was conducted mostly by myself with a team to facilitate the beginning stages of the process. We broke into groups once we defined what scope our project would tackle and after the initial interviews began. The team helped me focus on building out a persona, empathy, and journey map, to better understand the customer and their needs. Periodically we would converge to share my research findings and discuss any adjustments or take any suggestions. I gained insights on how to improve my personal process through these group discussions. Building out prototypes I was able to create a design which acknowledged Brads pain points and redefine problem areas in my second prototype.</p>

		<h2>Retrospective</h2>
		<p>Working primarily independently through interviews, persona building, prototyping, and design iteration, I delivered a final product that received a positive reaction from customers. I would have preferred more time to conduct research and interviews to ensure delivery of a excellent product. If time permitted, constructed of a more refined final prototype would have been built. The goal was to build a better drive-in by thoughtfully incorporated several new features, re-designing and modernizing a drive-in restaurant. We improved efficiency and received a positive reaction from those interviewed.</p>
