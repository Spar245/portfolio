		<h2>Inspiration Board</h2>
		<p>In order to understand the needs of our client, we individually created an inspiration board or mood board to capture the coastal lifestyle. During the entire process of development we converged to gather data and diverged to create our own unique designs.</p>

		<h2>Car Considerations</h2>
		<p>In order for the Spray App work with Android Audio car features I had to be mindful of some considerations. I was also very concerned about safety and navigation. Image sizes were sure to be large and easily use with touch screen. Text and typography would need to be legible. For ease of operations I examined voice command and steering navigation. Simplicity was key as drivers would need to distinguish between functions and patterns and few steps lead to less distracted driving.
